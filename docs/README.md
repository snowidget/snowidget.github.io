### a sandbox for tools, analyses, and other personal projects
This is my first, learn-by-doing effort at web development.
So, expect to see some mistakes and inefficiencies as we move along!

Here is a [map leaflet](leaflet_example.html)
made in HTML

Here is a [widget](math_widget.html) made in an ipython notebook, which 
needed to have its widgets embedded into an HTML, although it still 
doesn't work.

A more involved widget for [plotting CDFs](huc8cdf_widget_v0.html) -- similar issues
